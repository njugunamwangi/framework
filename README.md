HMVC stands for Hierarchical Model View Controller.

This approach is meant to break down development into modules rather than the normal MVC patterns. 


HOW TO INSTALL
===================================

Here's where all the fun is, install like you would Codeigniter.

Create a database named framework then import the framework.sql file at the root of the installation

Enjoy.
